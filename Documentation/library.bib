abstract = {The first four chapters of this book give a comprehensive and unified theory of the Krylov methods. Many of these are shown to be particular examples ofthe block conjugate-gradient algorithm and it is this observation thatpermits the unification of the theory. The two major sub-classes of thosemethods, the Lanczos and the Hestenes-Stiefel, are developed in parallel asnatural generalisations of the Orthodir (GCR) and Orthomin algorithms. Theseare themselves based on Arnoldi's algorithm and a generalised Gram-Schmidtalgorithm and their properties, in particular their stability properties,are determined by the two matrices that define the block conjugate-gradientalgorithm. These are the matrix of coefficients and the preconditioningmatrix.In Chapter 5 the"transpose-free" algorithms based on the conjugate-gradient squared algorithm are presented while Chapter 6 examines the various ways in which the QMR technique has been exploited. Look-ahead methods and general block methods are dealt with in Chapters 7 and 8 while Chapter 9 is devoted to error analysis of two basic algorithms.In Chapter 10 the results of numerical testing of the more important algorithms in their basic forms (i.e. without look-ahead or preconditioning) are presented and these are related to the structure of the algorithms and the general theory. Graphs illustrating the performances of various algorithm/problem combinations are given via a CD-ROM.Chapter 11, by far the longest, gives a survey of preconditioning techniques. These range from the old idea of polynomial preconditioning via SOR and ILU preconditioning to methods like SpAI, AInv and the multigrid methods that were developed specifically for use with parallel computers. Chapter 12 is devoted to dual algorithms like Orthores and the reverse algorithms of Hegedus. Finally certain ancillary matters like reduction to Hessenberg form, Chebychev polynomials and the companion matrix are described in a series of appendices.· comprehensive and unified approach· up-to-date chapter on preconditioners· complete theory of stability· includes dual and reverse methods· comparison of algorithms on CD-ROM· objective assessment of algorithms},

@article{Avitabile2014,
abstract = {We investigate coarse equilibrium states of a fine-scale, stochastic agent-based model of consumer lock-in in a duopolistic market. In the model, agents decide on their next purchase based on a combination of their personal preference and their neighbours' opinions. For agents with independent identically-distributed parameters and all-to-all coupling, we derive an analytic approximate coarse evolution-map for the expected average purchase. We then study the emergence of coarse fronts when spatial segregation is present in the relative perceived quality of products. We develop a novel Newton-Krylov method that is able to compute accurately and efficiently coarse fixed points when the underlying fine-scale dynamics is stochastic. The main novelty of the algorithm is in the elimination of the noise that is generated when estimating Jacobian-vector products using time-integration of perturbed initial conditions. We present numerical results that demonstrate the convergence properties of the numerical method, and use the method to show that macroscopic fronts in this model destabilise at a coarse symmetry-breaking bifurcation.},

@techreport{Garnier,
abstract = {We consider a system of diffusion processes that interact through their empirical mean and have a stabilizing force acting on each of them, corresponding to a bistable potential. There are three parameters that characterize the system: the strength of the intrinsic stabilization, the strength of the external random perturbations, and the degree of cooperation or interaction between them. The latter is the rate of mean reversion of each component to the empirical mean of the system. We interpret this model in the context of systemic risk and analyze in detail the effect of cooperation between the components, that is, the rate of mean reversion. We show that in a certain regime of parameters increasing cooperation tends to increase the stability of the individual agents but it also increases the overall or systemic risk. We use the theory of large deviations of diffusions interacting through their mean field.},

@article{Bold2012,
abstract = {We propose and illustrate an approach to coarse-graining the dynamics of evolving networks (networks whose connectivity changes dynamically). The approach is based on the equation-free framework: short bursts of detailed network evolution simulations are coupled with lifting and restriction operators that translate between actual network realizations and their (appropriately chosen) coarse observables. This framework is used here to accelerate temporal simulations (through coarse projective integration), and to implement coarsegrained fixed point algorithms (through matrix-free Newton-Krylov GMRES). The approach is illustrated through a simple network evolution example, for which analytical approximations to the coarse-grained dynamics can be independently obtained, so as to validate the computational results. The scope and applicability of the approach, as well as the issue of selection of good coarse observables are discussed.},
